/**
 * Starts flexible update
 * Use to check for updates parallel to main application flow.
 *
 * If update found gets [AppUpdateView.resultContractRegistry] and starts play-core update consent on behalf of your activity.
 * Therefore you need to implement a result registry in your view.
 * Whenever the update is downloaded wrapper will call [AppUpdateView.updateReady]. At this point your view
 * should ask if user is ready to restart application.
 * Then call one of the continuation methods: [AppUpdateWrapper.userConfirmedUpdate] or [AppUpdateWrapper.userCanceledUpdate]
 *
 * * Calls [AppUpdateView.updateComplete] when update complete (but you may not receive it as your app is restarted
 * during update installation)
 * * Calls [AppUpdateView.updateFailed] if update is not available or failed to install
 * @receiver Lifecycle owner (activity or fragment)
 * @param appUpdateManager AppUpdateManager instance
 * @param view Application update UI interaction view
 * @param flowBreaker Terminates update flow if user has already cancelled an update. Use to not to bother user with
 * update popups
 * @see UpdateFlowBreaker.withInterval
 * @see UpdateFlowBreaker.forOneDay
